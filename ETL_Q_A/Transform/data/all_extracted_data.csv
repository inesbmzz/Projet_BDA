0,What Is Autism Spectrum Disorder?,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which means that it impacts how a child develops. Autism begins in utero although children with ASD might not be diagnosed until they are preschool- or even school-aged (or older) when signs of the disorder become more apparent. Children with ASD have a combination of two kinds of behaviors: deficits in communication and social skills and the presence of restricted or repetitive behaviors. It’s called a spectrum because individuals with the disorder may have a wide range of symptoms cognitive abilities language skills and behaviors. Criteria for autism spectrum disorder Signs of a deficit in communication and social skills may include but are not limited to a combination of the following: In younger kids (under 3 years) In older children Children with restricted or repetitive behaviors perform repetitive actions and rituals and can become fixated on minute details to the point of distraction. In addition they may: To meet the criteria for ASD a child’s symptoms in these two areas must be present in early childhood though they may not become fully clear until later when social demands exceed limited capacities. Alternatively they may be clear early on and then masked later by learned strategies. These symptoms must also cause clinically significant impairment in social occupational academic or other important areas of functioning. In addition to the two required criteria to meet thediagnosisdiagnosis     A specific set of signs and symptoms that together define a disorder. For psychiatric disorders the criteria are based on standards established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).  children withautism spectrum disorderautism spectrum disorder     A spectrum of developmental deficits that begin in early childhood and may include impaired reciprocal social behavior communication and language as well as restricted and repetitive thoughts and behaviors. Many individuals also have cognitive impairments. These conditions have been thought of as a set of disorders but are now being considered one disorder that presents along a spectrum. often have sensory issues and varying cognitive and verbal abilities. Sensory problems: Many children with autism are unusually sensitive to sounds lights textures or smells. They may be overwhelmed by too much sensory input avoiding fleeing or melting down over things like bright lights loud noises or commotion. Alternatively they may seek more sensory input which they may try to get by bumping into things and excessively touching and smelling things. Verbal ability: Some children with autism don’t talk at all. Others talk in a stilted tone or in an exaggerated “sing-song” or high-pitched voice. Highly verbal children with autism may monopolize conversations while showing little capacity for reciprocity or understanding what the other person wants or feels. Autistic children may also repeat certain phrases without appearing to understand their significance or possess what experts call “non-functional knowledge”— information they can recite but not use to solve problems or carry on a conversation. Children on the spectrum can also have medical problems and other mental health disorders including anxietyADHDADHDsee attention-deficit hyperactivity disorderand depression with symptoms that can be confused with autism.,childmind
1,Terminology: “Autistic” “With Autism” and “Asperger’s”,People use different language when talking about autism. Some prefer to say “a child with autism” because it emphasizes the child’s identity outside of their diagnosis. This is commonly called “person-first” language and is often recommended as a respectful way to talk about disabilities and other health issues. However other people including many autism activists prefer to use the term “autistic.” This is known as “identity-first” language. Autistic self-advocates assert that being autistic is in fact part of who they are — just like other labels like Catholic African-American gifted and so on. They argue that saying “with autism” implies that autism is a negative thing that has happened to a person rather than an integral part of their identity. In this guide we use both “autistic” and “with autism” to acknowledge the diversity of people’s opinions. Some people also refer to their child having “Asperger’s disorder.” That diagnosis is technically outdated because in 2013 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) combined Asperger’s disorder into autism spectrum disorder. However many people do continue to use the term Asperger’s to describe autistic children who are typically without language or intellectual impairment.,childmind
2,How Is Autism Diagnosed?,The diversity of autism spectrum disorder can make it difficult to correctly diagnose. Sometimes children with ASD are mistakenly diagnosed with a different disorder like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) oroppositionaloppositional     Disobedient and often hostile behavior directed towards authority figures. defiant disorder (ODD) or they are told that nothing is wrong. Other times kids are diagnosed with autism when they actually aren’t on the spectrum. First Steps: There are a variety of screeners that pediatricians or other practitioners might employ as a first step to learning if a child might have autism before beginning a formal evaluation. Some are questionnaires that parents fill out and others are assessments done by clinicians. If a screener indicates that a child may have autism spectrum disorder the child should receive a comprehensive evaluation with someone trained in diagnosing autism. This evaluation should include assessment of a child’s behaviors in different settings and within the context of their overall development and it should incorporate both clinician observation and parent/caregiver interviews. Evaluations will often include autism-symptom specific measures such as: Evaluations should also include information about other areas of a child’s functioning across contexts. Assessing a child’s cognitive motor language and adaptive functioning can provide information on the most appropriate treatments and the impact their symptoms are having on their overall functioning. This includes using measures like: Even with these tools it is important to be working with a mental health professional who has experience diagnosing people on the autism spectrum.

3,Why Autism Diagnoses Are Often Delayed,For children on the autism spectrum the earlier they receive specialized support the better outcome they are likely to have. Such early intervention can start in toddlerhood. But children sometimes miss out on that crucial intervention for a variety of reasons. In many cases kids initially receive a diagnosis of speech-language impairments ADHD or sensory issues and it’s not until the social and academic challenges of school increase— around the age of 5 or 6 — that the child receives an autism diagnosis. It’s not that these other diagnoses are necessarily wrong. It is estimated that 30 to 40 percent of children on the autism spectrum do also have ADHD and sensory challenges are so common in kids with autism they are considered a symptom of the disorder. But all too often once a diagnosis is reached parents and clinicians stop looking carefully at symptoms that would also indicate an autism diagnosis which would change the treatment significantly. While these children are getting treatment for ADHD or sensory issues they’re missing out on therapy that can have a much more important impact on their lives. Read more about delayed diagnosis here. Why girls with autism are often overlooked Boys are diagnosed with autism at more than four times the rate of girls. The disorder is more common in boys but because girls often don’t fit the stereotyped image of someone with autism many girls go undiagnosed and suffer as a result. Some reasons for the missed diagnosis include: Read more about how girls are undiagnosed here.,childmind
4,How to Talk to Family and Friends About Your Child’s Diagnosis,If your child has been newly diagnosed with autism one thing that can be a challenge is telling your parents and extended family. Autism is something that more and more people are aware of but there’s still a lot of misinformation. The problems your child is having may not be visible to everyone in your family. But you need the people you are close to as allies in helping your child so getting them on your team is important. Focus on behaviors Using behaviors others might have noticed — such as lack of eye contact frequent meltdowns or inability to connect with other kids — is one way to start explaining what autism is and why your child was diagnosed. Explain autism basics Don’t overwhelm them with information but make sure to tell them that: Read more about talking with family and friends here.,childmind
5,Medical Causes for Autism-Related Behaviors,It’s not unusual for medical problems to be overlooked in kids with autism especially those who are nonverbal. When evaluating your child’s behaviors it’s crucial to consider that some may actually be reactions to pain or discomfort from treatable medical or dental conditions that may have gone unrecognized. Kids with ASD may not be able identify or articulate the source of the pain or discomfort they are experiencing effectively. Here are some commonly misinterpreted behaviors that may have medical causes: If you notice any of these behaviors in your child visiting your physician is a good idea to identify or rule out different medical problems including: Read more about possible medical causes here.,childmind
6,Sensory Issues,Sensory issues are often first recognized during the toddler years when parents notice that a child has an unusual aversion to noise light shoes that are deemed too tight and clothes that are irritating. They may also notice clumsiness and trouble climbing stairs and difficulty with fine motor skills like wielding a pencil and fastening buttons. More baffling — and alarming — to parents are children who exhibit extreme behaviors such as: These and other atypical behaviors may reflect sensory issues — difficulty integrating information from the senses. Children with sensory issues may be overwhelmed by too much sensory input (i.e. hyper-sensitivity) or receive too little (i.e. hypo-sensitivity) which causes them to bump into and rub against things in order to feel more. Sensory problems are now considered a symptom of autism because the majority of children and adults on the spectrum also have sensory issues. When the brain struggles to deal with sensory input like sound light and smell kids can become overwhelmed and may have a tendency to flee to a more calming environment become aggressive or experience a severe meltdown. In the majority of cases sensory issues become significantly milder and less interfering as kids get older. Skills learned in occupational therapy and environmental accommodations can help limit the impact of sensory issues as kids get older. Read more about sensory issues here.,childmind
7,Rigid Eating Habits in Children on the Spectrum,Children on the autism spectrum are often very picky eaters. When mealtime issues arise your first stop should be a pediatric gastroenterologist who has experience with kids on the spectrum to make sure there are no medical issues. Other sources of mealtime problems include:  Sensory issues: Autistic kids often express a strong preference for foods that feel a certain way in their mouths. Some prefer soft or creamy foods like yogurt soup or ice cream; others need the stimulation that crunchy foods like Cheetos or — if a parent is lucky carrots — provide. In either case that can put significant limitations on the different foods kids are willing to eat. Underdeveloped oral motor musculature: Kids who eat almost exclusively soft foods may actually lack the muscle development that it takes to chew foods like steak or hamburger. Parents who don’t know this is the cause of their child’s distress will respond by allowing them to forgo the foods that would strengthen those muscles so it becomes a vicious cycle. Time and behavior at the table: Lots of parents experience the frustration of trying to get their children to sit at the table long enough to finish a meal. But with autistic kids the challenge can be magnified. And there is also the issue of safety. Unsafe behaviors might include throwing utensils or repeatedly getting up and running from the table. For children and families who are struggling with an autistic child’s rigid eating habits consulting a feeding specialist —this could be a child psychologist speech-language pathologist or occupational therapist — can be helpful. Read more about autism and picky eating here.,childmind
8,Wandering in Children on the Spectrum,The tendency of children on the spectrum to wander off impulsively is a huge safety issue. Wandering off without warning — also known as elopement or bolting — can have tragic results as children attracted to water have drowned. The behavior is in part attributed to an impaired sense of danger which might inhibit a neurotypical child from leaving caregivers. Other explanations for bolting range from goal-directed (heading to a favorite place pursuing something of interest) to escaping astressorstressor     A stimulus or event that leads to a stress reaction. (an anxious situation or uncomfortable sensory stimuli). In a survey more than 800 parents reported that roughly 50 percent of children between the ages of 4 and 10 with an ASD wander at some point four times more than their unaffected siblings. The behavior peaks at 4 but almost 30 percent of kids with an ASD between the ages of 7 and 10 are still eloping eight times more than their unaffected brothers and sisters. The Autism Wandering Awareness Alerts Response and Education (AWAARE) Collaboration site has advice for families about making the home safe and other measures to guard against wandering.

9,Repetitive Motions,Repetitive movements associated with autism are sometimes called stimming. The word stim is short for self-stimulation. It means repetitive movements that don’t appear to be purposeful including hand flapping rocking blinking pacing and repeating noises or words. Among the criteria for an ASD diagnosis is “stereotyped or repetitive motor movements use of objects or speech.” Some children engage in these repetitive movements to either block or increase sensory input or as a means of alleviating distress. Children on the spectrum may stim both when they’re excited and when they’re frustrated or angry. But these movements are only problematic if they interfere with a child’s functioning including social interaction daily activities and learning. Families worried about them are encouraged not to try to eradicate or draw undue attention to them but instead to help children build communication skills and activities that may reduce time spent stimming. Read more about autism and repetitive motions here.,childmind
10,Autism-Related Problems With Transitions,Transitions are particularly challenging for kids with autism and their reactions can be extreme. They may feel the need for sameness and routine is a way of adapting to a world that can be overwhelming and confusing. Deviation from the routine can feel very uncomfortable even distressing and they may refuse to transition or engage in disruptive behavior such as having a tantrum. Maintaining structured routines may help children with autism especially for everyday transitions that are challenging like bedtime or school mornings. It may also be helpful to provide children visual schedules of their routines as well as provide warnings (countdowns to the next activity) before upcoming transitions. It’s important to note that these general strategies while helpful may not be sufficient for all children with autism. Rewarding kids when they handle a transition particularly well can also be an effective strategy. A reward could be as simple as labeled praise (for example saying “I really like how you stopped playing on the iPad when I told you it was time to get dressed. Good job!” Children can also be motivated by rewards like stickers or points that work up to bigger rewards like more screen time or a favorite food. Access to a child’s special interests can also be a reward. Read more about transitions here.,childmind
11,Behavioral Treatments for Autism,Behavioral treatments have been created to help children on the spectrum build skills they don’t develop automatically and reduce behaviors that are interfering with learning and communication. Several common types of treatment are described here: Applied Behavior Analysis: What it is: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) has been shown to help autistic children develop needed skills and minimize undesired behaviors such as self-injury and it has been shown to be successful for kids all across the autism spectrum. Its effectiveness is backed up by hundreds of studies. How it works: ABA is an evidence-basedbehavioral therapybehavioral therapy     A form of treatment that focuses directly on reducing or managing problematic behaviors without particular attention to thoughts events or circumstances that prompted the behaviors. that can take many forms but they are all based on the same simple concept: reinforced behaviors will increase; behaviors that are not reinforced will reduce and eventually disappear. Types of ABA: Read more about ABA here. Functional Communication Training: What it is: FCT involves teaching an individual a reliable way of expressing their wants and needs with language signs or images. It’s called “functional” because it doesn’t just teach kids to label an item (such as associating the word RED to a picture of an apple) but focuses on using words or signs to get something needed or desired — a food a toy an activity a trip to the bathroom a break from something. FCT uses positive reinforcement to teach children to communicate effectively with others to get their needs met and reduce problematic behavior. How it works: Initially the therapist prompts the child to use the word sign or picture and obtain the reward. This supported communication is repeated each time resulting in the earned reward until the child is able to succeed with less and less prompting from the therapist. Once kids are reliably using the functional communication for that item when the item is present the next step is for them to “generalize” or use it outside the specific situation in which it’s been taught such as communicating with people other than the therapist. Read more about functional communication training here. The Verbal Behavior Approach (VB): What it is:  The verbal behavior approach based on ABA emphasizes teaching children language and other skills in a child-centered learning environment. How it works: Therapists using a VB approach teach children language in a way that links language to its different purposes or functions. Initially therapists using a VB approach focus on pairing the learning environment with activities and items that a child enjoys so that the learning environment is somewhere the child wants to be. This might involve the therapist giving a child fun toys or snacks for free. The therapist then teaches children to request (what VB therapists call to mand) for these things. Once children are independently requesting things they want the therapist gradually begins teaching other language and skill goals (such as labeling and responding to questions). The VB approach is used with children who communicate with spoken language as well as children who communicate in other ways such as sign language. Books like The Verbal Behavior Approach: How to Teach Children With Autism and Related Disorders provide more information about this teaching approach. Parent Training for Disruptive Behaviors in Autism Spectrum Disorder: What it is: This evidence-based treatment from the RUBI Autism Network is based on the principles of ABA. It addresses challenging behaviors in youth with ASD including noncompliance aggression temper outbursts and difficulties with transitions. How it works: The therapist works closely with the parent to teach techniques (such as prevention strategies daily schedules reinforcement compliance training functional communication training) to reduce their child’s challenging behaviors and to encourage more appropriate behaviors. Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS®) What it is: PEERS® is an evidence-based social skills intervention for youth with social challenges. How it works: The intervention is delivered in a group format (parent and youth groups) to teach practical social skills such as how to start and end conversations select appropriate friends handle teasing and bullying handle arguments with peers and show good sportsmanship. Facing Your Fears (FYF): What it is: Facing Your Fears is a group-based cognitive behavioral treatment designed to help youth with ASD who also have anxiety symptoms. How it works: Facing Your Fears helps children learn to identify their worries and develop healthy coping strategies they can rely on when they are feeling anxious. Children are also given the opportunity to practice these new strategies inside their group. In addition to the child group there is a separate group for parents to learn how to help support their child with ASD and co-occurring anxiety. Occupational Therapy: What it is: Occupational therapy known as OT is designed to help children acquire the skills needed to perform the activities—or “occupations”—of daily life. How it works: Occupational therapists work with children to develop a variety of skills or abilities. This may include fine and gross motor skills help with feeding issues or sensory issues or developing essential self-help skills like brushing teeth dressing toilet training and more.

12,Medication for Children on the Autism Spectrum,There is no medication for the symptoms of autism. But children on the spectrum may take medication that is aimed at curbing aggression or other problematic or dangerous behavior. And kids on the spectrum may take medication for other disorders that they may have including anxiety depression or ADHD. Any doctor prescribing medication should do so carefully but this is particularly important for children who may have multiple diagnoses. Medication for behavior problems Risperdal is a medication that’s widely used to treat children who are aggressive or excessively irritable. Risperdal can successfully calm down kids with severe behavior problems enabling them to function in school and within their families. The FDA has approved it for that use. Without it some children would require residential treatment. It’s important to know that Risperdal has side effects that include substantial weight gain and metabolic neurological and hormonal changes that can be harmful. Without effective monitoring by a professional some children experience irreversible damage. Some experts are concerned that children are being treated with this medication in lieu of other treatment — including behavioral treatment — that could be effective without the risk of these side effects. Read more about Risperdal here. Medication for co-occurring ADHD Most children with ADHD are prescribed stimulant medications. Different children metabolize medication in different ways so finding the right type of stimulant and dosage for your child may take several weeks. Other children may be prescribed non-stimulant medication if they are not responding to stimulants or experience troubling side-effects even after careful adjustment of dosage or type of stimulant. Medication for co-occurring depression Medications most often prescribed to treat depression are selective serotoninreuptake inhibitorsreuptake inhibitors     Medications that increase the supply of neurotransmitters in the brain by blocking their re-absorption and rapid destruction.  or SSRIs which are also known as antidepressants. Clinicians may also prescribe an atypicalantidepressant.antidepressantA class of medications originally designed to treat depression and other mood disorders. There are many kinds of antidepressants from the newer SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and SNRIs (Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) as well as the older and less frequently prescribed tricyclics and MAOIs. Some antidepressants are also useful for treating anxiety disorders. A class of medications originally designed to treat depression and other mood disorders.

Some antidepressants are also useful for treating anxiety disorders. People struggling with depression can also benefit from therapy for depression such as cognitive behavior therapy dialectical behavior therapy or mindfulness. Medication for co-occurring anxiety The medications most often prescribed to treat anxiety are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs. Benzodiazepines are also sometimes prescribed for kids who are extremely anxious but people can develop a tolerance for them so they should be prescribed carefully. Behavior therapy such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best treatment for anxiety. Facing Your Fears is a kind of CBT developed for children with autism. Medication may be prescribed in addition to therapy or to make very anxious kids more open to therapy.,childmind
13,What is autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Practice EssentialsAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifests in early childhood and is characterized by qualitative abnormalities in socialinteractions, markedly aberrant communication skills, and restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities (RRBs).[1]ASD is the broad current designation for a group of conditions with deficits in social interaction and communication andRRBs. ASD includes a variety of disorders that fit two broad classes: (1) genetic disorders with features of ASD includingfragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis, and (2) idiopathic with unknown causes. Idiopathic forms of ASDhave been called a variety of terms over the years, including autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, andAsperger syndrome. Further information about the subtypes can be located in the articles for each condition. Readers canbenefit from recognizing that the terms ""autism"" and ""autistic disorder"" have been used to describe ASD. ""Pervasivedevelopmental disorder"" had been used to describe disorders including ASD and conditions with some traits characteristic ofautism. Asperger syndrome refers to high-functioning individuals with ASD; these are people who have normal or superiorintellectual abilities. People with Asperger syndrome may lack the communication abnormalities characteristic of ASD.Indviduals with the genetic disorders associated with ASD may or may not manifest the symptoms and signs of ASD. Thedevelopment of techniques to help people with ASD attain favorable educational and occupational outcomes in communitysettings provide opportunities for the successful lives of people with ASD and their families.[2]",medscape
14,What are the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Signs and symptomsBehavioral and developmental features that suggest autism include the following:Developmental regressionAbsence of protodeclarative pointing, i.e., failure to look where the examiner is looking and pointingAbnormal reactions to environmental stimuliAbnormal social interactionsAbsence of smiling when greeted by parents and other familiar peopleAbsence of typical responses to pain and physical injuryLanguage delays and deviationsAbsence of symbolic playRepetitive and stereotyped behaviorRegular screening of infants and toddlers for symptoms and signs of ASD is crucial because it allows for early referral ofpatients for further evaluation and treatment.[1] Siblings of children with ASD are at risk for developing traits of ASD andeven a full-blown diagnosis of ASD. Therefore, siblings should also undergo screening not only for autism-related symptomsbut also for language delays, learning difficulties, social problems, and anxiety or depressive symptoms.[3]Having parents fill out the Autism Screening Checklist can identify children who merit further assessment for possible ASD.See the image below for a printable version of the checklist. emedicine.medscape.com/article/912781-print The significance of answers to individual Autism Screening Checklist items is as follows: Item 1- A ""yes"" occurs in healthychildren and children with some pervasive developmental disorders; a ""no"" occurs in children with autism, Rett syndrome,and other developmental disorders. Item 2 - A ""yes"" occurs in healthy children, not children with autism. Item 3 - A ""yes""occurs in healthy children and children with Asperger syndrome (ie, high-functioning autism); a ""no"" occurs in children withRett syndrome; children with autism may elicit a ""yes"" or a ""no""; some children with autism never speak; some childrenwith autism may develop speech normally and then experience a regression with the loss of speech. Item 4 - A ""yes""occurs in healthy children and children with Asperger syndrome and some other pervasive developmental disorders; a""no"" occurs in children with developmental disorders; children with autism may elicit a ""yes"" or a ""no."" Items 5-10 - Scoresof ""yes"" occur in some children with autism and in children with other disorders. Item 1 1 – A ""yes"" occurs in healthychildren; a ""no"" occurs in some children with autism and in children with other disorders. Items 12, 13 - Scores of ""yes""occur in some children with autism and in children with other disorders. Items 14-19 - Scores of ""yes"" occur in childrenwith schizophrenia and other disorders, not in children with autism, Asperger syndrome, or other autism spectrumdisorders.

16,What is the DSM-5 definition of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"ManagementThe established therapies for ASD are nonpharmacologic and may include individual intensive interventions. Individuals withASD  typically benefit from behaviorally oriented therapeutic programs developed specifically for this population.

18,Which imaging studies are performed in the workup of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Motion anomaliesMotion anomalies are a prominent feature in a subset of individuals and have been reported at birth in some persons withASD. Motion analysis may provide evidence of ASD in early infancy, before other manifestations occur.[12]The motion anomalies demonstrated by children with ASD are often highly characteristic and noticeable. An example of amotion typical in ASD occurs when the child places a hand with fingers separately outstretched before the eyes and rapidlymoves the hand back and forth. A similar experience results from moving up and down while gazing through the slats ofVenetian blinds. This action is described as self-stimulation because it produces a visual sensation of movement. (SeePresentation.)Many of the motions of children with ASD appear to be attempts to provide themselves with sensory input in a barrenenvironment. Through special education, children may learn to suppress the movements, although these may subsequentlybe exhibited at times of particular stress or excitement.",medscape
19,What types of interventions are used in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Although the etiology of ASD is unknown hypotheses include genetic abnormalities obstetric complications exposure to toxic agents and prenatal perinatal and postnatal infections. Genetic studies have contributed to our understanding of the inheritance of ASD. A susceptibility to ASD is likely associated with 400 to 1000 genes.[17] A heritability plays a role in 74% to 93% of the risk for ASD.[18] Increasing risk for ASD is independently associated with maternal age of 40 years and older paternal age of 50 years and older and interpregnancy intervals less than 24 months. Maternal rubella is associated with significantly higher rates of ASD and other conditions in children. Additionally tuberous sclerosis is associated with ASD as a comorbid disorder.[21] On the other hand anecdotal reports that ASD may be linked with vaccinations (eg for measles and rubella) have not been supported by broader research.[22] Research from the CDC indicates that the number of childhood vaccines administered either in a single day or during a child's first 2 years has no effect on the risk of developing ASD. According to esults of a case-control study of more than 1000 children born between January 1994 and December 1999 exposure to antibody-stimulating proteins or polysaccharides from vaccines between the ages of 3 months and 2 years was not associated with an increased risk of developing an ASD. The study included 256 children with an ASD and 752 healthy controls.[23 24] Parents should be encouraged to fully immunize their children.[25] (See Etiology.) Effective treatment of associated behavioral problems includes intensive behavioral educational and psychological romponents. Interventions initiated at the time of diagnosis increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome.[26] Regular screening of infants and toddlers for symptoms and signs of autistic disorder is crucial because it allows for early referral of patients for further evaluation and treatment. (See Treatment.) The initial clinical descriptions of ASD suggested that cold rejecting parents (refrigerator mothers"") caused autism in offspring; however careful study of children with ASD and their parents has disproved this hypothesis. Autism is not caused by a lack of warmth and affection in parents nor by any other emotional or psychological parental deficits. Blaming parents for the development of ASD in their children is inappropriate.""",medscape

Although several metabolic abnormalitieshave been identified in investigations of people with ASD (eg, elevated serotonin, reduced serum biotinidase, abnormalneurotransmitter functions, impaired phenolic amines metabolism), a metabolic workup should be considered on anindividual basis. No biologic markers for autism currently exist.Studies that may be helpful in the evaluation of ASD include the following:EEG, sleep-deprived:[7] To exclude seizure disorder, acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder (Landau-Kleffnersyndrome), biotin-responsive infantile encephalopathy, related conditionsPsychophysiologic assessment: To show lack of response habituation to repeatedly presented stimuli (in respiratoryperiod, electrodermal activity, vasoconstrictive peripheral pulse amplitude response); auditory overselectivity may beseenPolysomnography: To identify sleep disorders and to demonstrate seizure dischargesNeuroimaging studiesThere is currently no clinical evidence to support the role of routine clinical neuroimaging in the diagnostic evaluation ofASD, even in the presence of megalencephaly.[3] Although characteristic abnormalities have been identified, no singlefinding is diagnostic.The following imaging techniques have yielded inconsistent results in evaluating ASD:MRI with or without diffusion tensor imagingCT scanningPET scanningSPECT scanningSee Workup for more detail.",medscape
21,Which medications are used in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Individualized, intensive behavioral and psychological interventions must be instituted immediately after the diagnosisof ASD in order for the patient to achieve an optimal outcome. Although controversy surrounds the appropriate form ofspecial education, some evidence suggests that an individual educational program must be developed by a special educatorfamiliar with ASD and related conditions.Because deficits in language and communication are often major impediments to progress in educational, work, andpersonal settings, patients often benefit from specialized communication devices and training. Persons experienced in theneeds and treatment of individuals with serious communication handicaps (ie, speech and language specialists) may helpthe patient to maximize communication skills.Although psychoanalytic approaches to treatment of children with ASD were common in the mid-20th century, theseapproaches were not found to be effective and are no longer used. Pharmacotherapy is ineffective in treating the coredeficits of ASD but may be effective in treating associated behavioral problems and comorbid disorders. The possiblebenefits from pharmacotherapy must be balanced against the likely adverse effects on a case-by-case basis. ",medscape
22,When does autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically present?,"Neural anomaliesIn patients with autism, neuroanatomic and neuroimaging studies reveal abnormalities of cellular configurations in severalregions of the brain, including the frontal and temporal lobes and the cerebellum. Enlargements of the amygdala and thehippocampus are common in childhood. Markedly more neurons are present in select divisions of the prefrontal cortex ofautopsy specimens of some children with ASD, compared with those without ASD.[27]Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have suggested evidence for differences in neuroanatomy and connectivity inpeople with ASD compared with normal controls. Specifically, these studies have found reduced or atypical connectivity infrontal brain regions, as well as thinning of the corpus callosum in children and adults with ASD and related conditions.In a study that included 17 adults with high-functioning ASD and 17 age- and IQ-matched control subjects, functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain that showed neural representations of social interactions was able toaccurately identify individuals with ASD. Scans were performed as study subjects thought about a set of social interactionverbs from both an action and a recipient perspective.[28, 29]Importantly, some of the regional differences in neuroanatomy correlate significantly with the severity of specific autisticsymptoms.[30, 31] For example, social and language deficits of people with ASD likely are related to dysfunction of thefrontal and temporal lobes.[32]In a study of postmortem brain tissue from 11 children with ASD and 11 unaffected controls, researchers found focaldisruption of cortical laminar architecture in the cortexes of 10 of the children with ASD and 1 of the controls, suggesting thatbrain irregularities in ASD may have prenatal origins. The patches of abnormal neurons were found in the frontal andtemporal lobes, regions involved in social, emotional, communication, and language functions. Since the changes were inthe form of patches, the researchers believe that early treatment could rewire the brain and improve ASD symptoms.[33, 34]On MRI scans, the brains of children with ASD demonstrate greater myelination in bilateral medial frontal cortices and lessmyelination in the left temporoparietal junction.[35] Similarly, region-specific differences in the concentrations of gray matter,made up of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons and glial cells, are also found in the brains of people withautism.[36]",medscape
23,What are motion anomalies in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)Increased risk of developmental delay and ASD is associated with prematurity. Reductions in cerebral GABA likelycontribute to the sensorimotor and behavioral anomalies of individuals with ASD.[37, 38, 39] Reductions in sensorimotorGABA were observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in participants with ASD in contrast to matched controlswithout ASD.[37, 38] Behavioral measures of inhibition correlated with the reductions in sensorimotor GABA concentrations.[37, 38] By contrast, GABA concentrations were similar in a different cohort of boys with ASD and typical boys.[37, 40] In theboys with ASD the ratio of GABA/creatine on MRS was associated with symptoms of ASD.[37, 41]Postmortem specimens of the brains of people with ASD demonstrated reductions for gamma-aminobutyric acid–B(GABAB) receptors in the cingulate cortex, a key region for the evaluation of social relationships, emotions, and cognition,and in the fusiform gyrus, a crucial region to evaluate faces and facial expressions.[42] These findings provide the basis forfurther investigation of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders.",medscape
24,What causes autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Glutathione (GSH)As the main brain antioxidant glutathione (GSH) may play a role in the development of ASD.

26,How is autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treated?,"Metabolic anomaliesIn animal studies, dysfunction of serotonin and the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin has been associated withabnormalities in affiliative behaviors. Neurophysiologic dysfunction involving one or more of these substances may also bepresent in humans with ASD.Elevations of blood serotonin levels occur in approximately one third of individuals with ASD and are also reported in theparents and siblings of patients. Functional anomalies in other neurotransmitters (eg, acetylcholine, glutamate) have also emedicine.medscape.com/article/912781-print been identified in some people with ASD.[32, 47]Serum biotinidase is reduced in some people with ASD. This enzyme is required for the use and recycling of the B vitaminbiotin. Deficiency of biotin has been linked with behavioral disorders.Immunologic studies have identified abnormalities such as decreased plasma concentrations of the C4B complementprotein. Such abnormalities may be the source of the increased susceptibility to infection seen in some people with ASD.Diet is a controversial aspect of ASD. The greatest attention has been given to gluten- and casein-free diets; anecdotalinformation suggests that these diets help some children with ASD.[48] Test findings suggest that low-functioning childrenwith ASD may have impairment in the metabolism of phenolic amines.[49] Therefore, symptoms of ASD are possiblyaggravated by the consumption of dairy products, chocolates, corn, sugar, apples, and bananas; however, no largepopulation studies have confirmed this.Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis and the pathophysiology of ASD.[50] Compared with normal children,children with ASD have decrements in the following:[50]Plasma levels of cysteine, glutathione, and methionineThe ratio of S -adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to S -adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH)The ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathioneSome children with ASD display hyperlacticacidemia[51] as well as evidence of mitochondrial disorders[51] includingcarnitine deficiency.[52] These abnormalities may reflect disturbed neuronal energy metabolism.",medscape
27,What is the role of neural anomalies in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Mitochondrial dysfunctionSince mitochondrial function may be impaired in some individuals with ASD,[51, 53]  a lack of dietary components containingkey cofactors[54] may play a role in the pathogenesis.",medscape
28,What is the role of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,A low concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines may produce an imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro- inflammatory cytokines to trigger inflammation in ASD.[55] Infection in pregnancy may release inflammatory cytokines crossing the placenta to result in neuronal inflammation in the fetus.[56],medscape
29,What is the role of glutathione (GSH) in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"In the 1940s, in his seminal papers that first identified ASD, the child psychiatrist Leo Kanner conjectured that ASD resultedfrom rejection of the infant by emotionally cold parents (""refrigerator mothers""). In the 1950s and 1960s, Bruno Bettelheimpopularized this idea. Since then, careful family studies have disproved the hypothesis that the development of ASD inchildren is caused by faulty parenting. Sensitive clinicians communicate to parents that their parenting skills did not causetheir child's ASD. Repeated communication of this fact will help to minimize the guilt often experienced by parentsof children with ASD.The causes of ASD are unknown. Hypotheses include obstetric complications, infection, genetics, and toxic exposures.[57,58, 59] None of these, however, has been established as a definite etiology.Many factors have been associated with the risk for ASD, including maternal and paternal ages of 35 years or older,Caucasian or Asian race of mother or father, and college graduation of mother or father.[60]",medscape
30,What is the role of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Many individuals with ASD and related conditions experienced untoward events in their prenatal and neonatal periods and during delivery.[13, 14, 15, 61] It is unclear whether the obstetric complications caused ASD or whether ASD and obstetric complications resulted from environmental or other problems. During the perinatal period, the factors associated with ASD risk were hypertension or diabetes in mother, threatened abortion, antepartum hemorrhage, caesarian delivery, gestational age ≤ 36 weeks, parity ≥ 4, spontaneous labor, induced labor, no labor, breech presentation, preeclampsia, and fetal distress. During the postnatal period, the factors associated with ASD risk were low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage, male gender, and brain anomaly.[60] In a large Danish study published in JAMA, maternal use of valproate during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk for ASD in offspring. The drug is already not recommended for use in pregnant women due to the risk of congenital malformations and its possible association with low intelligence in children exposed during pregnancy. Researchers used data on all children born in Denmark between 1996 and 2006. Of the 655,615 children born in the study period, 5437 had ASD. There were 2644 children exposed to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy, 508 of whom were exposed to valproate. Analysis showed that the children exposed to valproate had a 3-fold increased risk for ASD compared with unexposed children, even after adjustment for parental psychiatric disease and epilepsy.[62, 63] The management of women with epilepsy who desire to bear children can be challenging. A woman with an ongoing seizure disorder requires treatment because maternal seizures can result in serious morbidity and mortality for the mother and the fetus. To stop anticonvulsant therapy when a woman with a seizure disorder becomes pregnant to avoid teratologic effects may precipitate uncontrolled seizures that may be fatal to the mother and the fetus. Therefore physicians treating women with child-bearing potential can appropriately initiate frank conversations about future pregnancies. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and other seizure disorders typically cause seizures throughout adulthood so pharmacotherapy throughout adulthood is a reasonable treatment plan. While valproate is an excellent agent to control a vast spectrum of seizure disorders, its use in women of child-bearing potential is fraught with danger due to the great risk of producing ASD, spina bifida, and other birth defects. A frank conversation between the physician and the woman of child-bearing potential about the risks and benefits of specific antiepileptic drugs for the mother and the fetus is indicated. Documentation of these conversations is the medical record is needed. This record may be useful in court if legal action is initiated if a child has birth defects.",medscape
31,What is the role of metabolic anomalies in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,An infectious basis for some cases of ASD is suggested by the large number of children with ASD born to women whocontracted rubella during pregnancy. This finding supports the hypothesis that this infection triggers a vulnerability to thedevelopment of ASD in the fetus.,medscape
32,What is the role of faulty parenting in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Familial and genetic factorsFamilial factors influence the risk for ASD. The rate of ASD in children born into families that already have a child with anautism spectrum disorder is as high as 18.7%, and the risk is twice as high in children born to families with 2 or morechildren with an ASD.[68] Girls born to a family that has a child with an ASD have 2.8 times the risk of having such adisorder.[68]Twin studies have demonstrated a moderate degree of genetic heritability for ASD,[69, 70, 71] with environment making asubstantial contribution to the development of these conditions in the study subjects.[71]Multiple family studies have suggested genetic components in many cases of ASD.[72, 61, 73] For example, someasymptomatic first-degree relatives of some probands with ASD have abnormalities in serotonin and other chemicals similarto the probands.Finding genetic bases for ASD is a promising research goal. Factor analysis of datasets from the Autism Genome Projecthas suggested linkage of a joint attention factor with 11q23 and of a repetitive sensory-motor behavior factor with 19q13.[74]While a third of monozygotic twins are concordant for ASD, dizygotic twins are concordant for autism at rates of 4-8%,[75]which is comparable to siblings. A focused neurogenetic evaluation of children with ASD yields a genetic disorder in twofifths of the children.[76] For example, mutations in the gene SHANK3 are associated with ASD.[77, 78]Fragile X syndrome, a subtype of ASD, can be identified through genetic testing.[79] Antagonists to metabotropic glutamatereceptors can reverse the symptoms in mouse models of fragile X syndrome.[80] Another subtype of ASD is tuberoussclerosis, a disorder with specific genetic mutations.[81, 82]",medscape
33,What is the role of obstetric complications in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Toxic exposureExposures to toxins, chemicals, poisons, and other substances have been hypothesized to cause ASD.Roberts et al[83] and Samson[84] have reported an association between exposure to the organochlorine pesticides dicofoland endosulfan during the first trimester of pregnancy and the subsequent development of ASD in children. Potentialmothers can wisely be advised to avoid exposure to organochlorine pesticides.In parts of the world, exposure to specific toxins may influence local ASD rates. For example, the high incidence of ASD inareas of Japan has been hypothesized to be due to a toxic effect of certain fish. Although toxins may play a role in thedevelopment of isolated cases of ASD in Japan, they have not been proved to be generally causative of ASD there. Anotherpossible explanation for the high ASD rates in Japan is the excellent training of Japanese clinicians; low rates elsewheremay reflect the limited abilities of clinicians to diagnose ASD. emedicine.medscape.com/article/912781-print Some studies have documented associations between ASD and air pollution. One, from North Carolina found a link betweenexposure to traffic-related air pollution, particularly during the third trimester, to the development of ASD in offspring. Theseresults add to the evidence already provided by previous studies conducted in California.[85]Another study of children living in counties in Pennsylvania found that children with ASD were 1.4 to two times more likely tohave been exposed to higher levels of air pollution, especially the toxins styrene and chromium, during pregnancy and thefirst 2 years of life than children without the disorder.[86] Cyanide, methylene chloride, methanol, and arsenic were alsolinked to increased risk of ASD.[87]",medscape
34,What is the role of fetal exposure to infectious agents in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Parental ageMeta-analyses of epidemiologic studies have shown that ASD risk in offspring increases when the age of either parent is 35years or higher.[60] Sandin et al reported that, after controlling for paternal age, the adjusted relative risk for ASD was 1.52in the offspring of mothers aged 35 years or older compared with mothers aged 25–29 years.[88] Hultman et al found that,after controlling for maternal age, offspring of men aged 50 years or older were 2.2 times more likely to have ASD thanoffspring of men aged 29 years or younger.[89]",medscape
35,What is the role of genetics in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"VaccinationSome children have developed ASD after immunizations, including inoculations for measles, mumps, and rubella. However,several population studies have demonstrated no association between childhood immunization and the development of ASDand related conditions.[90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95]Thompson and colleagues detected no causal association between exposure to vaccines that contain thimerosal andneuropsychological deficits at age 7–10 years.[93] In fact, in early 2010, the Lancet retracted the 1998 article by Wakefieldet al that originally linked ASD with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination, citing flaws in the study and 2 claims in itthat were ""proven to be false.""[94]Parents can permit the recommended childhood immunizations without fear of causing ASD and related conditions.Adherence to recommended immunization schedules, including immunization for measles, mumps, and rubella, is highlyrecommended.[95]",medscape
36,What is the role of toxins in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"EpidemiologyReported rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been rising in many countries over the past two decades.[96, 97]In 2021, the CDC released data showing a record-breaking increase in rates of autism since the organization began trackingthe disorder in 2000. Study authors with the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Networkattribute this increase to improvements in diagnosis and identification of ASD and not necessarily to an increase inincidence. The researchers found that 2.3% of 8-year-olds in communities in 11 states across the United States had anautism diagnosis in 2018 (prevalence rate of 1 in 44 children), up from 1.9% in 2016.[98]Epidemiological studies of relatively uncommon conditions such as ASD are expensive. A suitable research strategy is theadministration of multiple screenings in a population, each time identifying more likely subjects for detailed investigation.For example, a reporting tool, such as the Autism Screening Checklist, can be distributed to all parents and guardians in atarget population. See the image below. emedicine.medscape.com/article/912781-print The significance of answers to individual Autism Screening Checklist items is as follows: Item 1- A ""yes"" occurs in healthychildren and children with some pervasive developmental disorders; a ""no"" occurs in children with autism, Rett syndrome,and other developmental disorders. Item 2 - A ""yes"" occurs in healthy children, not children with autism. Item 3 - A ""yes""occurs in healthy children and children with Asperger syndrome (ie, high-functioning autism); a ""no"" occurs in children withRett syndrome; children with autism may elicit a ""yes"" or a ""no""; some children with autism never speak; some childrenwith autism may develop speech normally and then experience a regression with the loss of speech.

55,Which types of play are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Screening well babies for signs predictive of autism spectrum disorder is important.[1] Baron-Cohen and colleaguesobserved that abnormalities in pretend play, gaze monitoring, and protodeclarative pointing noted in toddlers during well-child visits in the United Kingdom were useful in predicting the later diagnosis of ASD.[123, 124]Baron-Cohen and colleagues developed a set of valid and reliable tools to screen for ASD over the lifespan,[128] includingthe Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) and its revisions, the Modified CHAT (MCHAT) and the Quantitative CHAT(QCHAT), for newborns and toddlers,[123, 124, 129] as well as the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), for children,[130]adolescents,[131] and adults.[132] The possible cultural limitations of these tools in different ethnic groups in variousgeographic regions remain to be demonstrated.Pretend playIn screening for the presence of symbolic play, other make-believe play may be substituted based on cultural relevance. Thechild should respond appropriately to a pretend activity compared with most other children of the same culture.Gaze monitoringThe assessment of normal gaze monitoring, suggested by Baron-Cohen and colleagues, consists of the following steps: (1)the clinician calls the child's name, points to a toy on the other side of the room, and says, ""Oh look! There's a [name atoy]!"";[123, 124] (2) if the child looks across the room to see the item indicated by the clinician, then a joint attention isestablished, indicating normal gaze monitoring.Protodeclarative pointingBaron-Cohen and colleagues established the following protocol to assess for the presence of protodeclarative pointing:Say to the child, “Where's the light?” or “Show me the light”A normal response is for the child to point with his or her index finger at the light while looking up at the clinician'sface[123, 124]If the child does not respond appropriately, the procedure may be repeated with a teddy bear or any otherunreachable objectExecutive functionDeficits in executive function have been generally observed in people with ASD.[133]",medscape
56,How do children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) react to febrile illness?,"Body movementClumsiness, awkward walk, and abnormal motor movements are characteristic features of ASD. Manifestations of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder that are very often associated with ASD include hyperkinesis and stereotypies.Common abnormal motor movements in children with ASD include hand flapping, in which the upper extremity is rapidlyraised and lowered with a flaccid wrist so that the hand flaps like a flag in the wind. Hand flapping typically occurs when thechild is happy or excited. It may occur in combination with movement of the entire body, such as bouncing (ie, jumping upand down) and rotating (ie, constantly spinning around a vertical axis in the midline of the body).Children with ASD also often display motor tics and are unable to remain still. Because children with ASD are oftenintellectually impaired and nonverbal, expressing subjective experiences associated with the movement is often impossiblefor them. Thus, the diagnosis of akathisia cannot be applied in these cases, because this diagnosis requires theverbalization of a sensation of inner restlessness and an urge to move.",medscape

Thehead circumference may return to normal in adolescence.[5]",medscape
58,How are children screened for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Movement assessmentPatients with ASD merit a careful assessment of movements. The caregiver and clinicians may be asked whether the patientshows any unusual motions in the mouth, face, hands, or feet and, if so, may be asked to describe them and how theybother the patient. emedicine.medscape.com/article/912781-print The patient may be asked to sit on the chair with legs slightly apart, feet flat on the floor, and hands hanging supportedbetween the legs or hanging over the knees. The patient may be asked to open his or her mouth and then twice to stick outthe tongue.If the subject does not perform the requested action, the examiner then repeatedly performs the actions in the direct view ofthe subject to demonstrate the desired actions.The patient may be asked to sit, stand, and lie on a sheet on the floor for 2 minutes in each position and to remainmotionless while in each posture. In each position, the patient is asked, ""Do you have a sensation of inner restlessness?""and ""Do you have the urge to move?""

Nevertheless, the objective behavior of thechild can be observed and rated.",medscape
59,Which body movement findings are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Movements observed in individuals with ASD are frequently classified as stereotypies (eg, purposeless, repetitive, patterned motions, postures, and sounds). Stereotypies are divided into the following 3 topologic classes: Orofacial - Eg, tongue, mouth, and facial movements; smelling; and sniffing and other sounds Extremity - Eg, hand, finger, toe, and leg Head and trunk - Eg, rolling, tilting, or banging of the head, and rocking of the body Stereotypies occur in infants with ASD and in children with intellectual disability. Regular assessment of stereotypies is a valuable practice because stereotypies may bother other people and interfere with performance at school, work, and home. Routine assessment of stereotypies before, during, and after treatment is valuable in determining the effects of interventions. Stereotypies are assessed for clinical purposes through regular use of the Timed Stereotypies Rating Scale.

61,How are movements assessed in the physical exam for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Children with ASD and related conditions may persist incessantly with repetitive behaviors that annoy others, despite instructions to cease. Children with ASD typically do not respond to spanking and other forms of traditional discipline. Parents, teachers, and others may eventually lose control and inflict physical injury on the child. For this reason, children with ASD are at high risk for physical abuse; in addition, when physical abuse occurs, these children may not report it. Therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers must maintain a high level of suspicion for the possibility of physical abuse when assessing children with ASD and must conduct regular, careful physical examinations.",medscape

The American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society found inadequate evidence to recommend an electroencephalogram (EEG) in all individuals with ASD.[3] Consultation with an electroencephalographer may help to determine appropriate procedures for individual cases. A single normal EEG does not rule out a paroxysmal abnormality, such as a seizure disorder. When a routine EEG does not reveal unequivocal evidence of a seizure disorder in a patient who may have one (eg, partial seizures with complex symptomatology), specialized procedures may help to clarify the diagnosis. Measurements of electroencephalographic activity after sleep deprivation and after stimulation with light, noise, and tactile sensations using nasopharyngeal leads, as well as the use of video monitoring simultaneously with electroencephalography, may be helpful in such cases. Neurologic consultation can also be beneficial. Indications for performing a sleep-deprived EEG with appropriate sampling of slow-wave sleep in patients with ASD are clinical seizures (or suspicion of subclinical seizures) and clinically significant loss of social and communicative function, especially in toddlers and preschoolers.[3] Admission to a specialized unit for simultaneous 24-hour video monitoring of electroencephalography and movement of the patient for a few days of assessment may facilitate the establishment of or the exclusion",medscape

108,My daughter is 2 years old and was recently diagnosed with autism. I have some family members who keep insisting she’s just delayed. Can you give me any suggestions for how to respond to them,Your situation is very common in families of children diagnosed with special needs most especially autism. There are so many emotional processes that are occurring for the family as a unit and for each family member individually after getting this diagnosis. Of course there is the initial shock that can send you spiraling into a true grieving process and each of you in the family will work through this in your own time frame. Part of that process includes a stage of denial as particularly seen from family members who aren’t living with your child day-to-day. It’s probable that it will take them longer to come to terms with the diagnosis. In addition to everything else you are doing you must also remain patient for this to happen. Family members who love your child will benefit most from learning about autism so they can adapt their interactions and expectations to more appropriate levels. There are also professionals and effective support groups in your community who have a lot of experience and expertise in understanding this process. They may be able to provide you and your extended family with assistance.,parent_guid
109,My husband refuses to accept the diagnosis and will not attend appointments with our doctor. What can I do,This is not uncommon where one parent accepts the diagnosis and the other is in denial. Denial happens both to fathers and mothers. As difficult as it may be for you at a time like this you must be patient and supportive. Your spouse will eventually work through his or her denial. Meanwhile you might try to recommend a book or share an article about autism but be careful not to pressure. Most people need to do this on their own terms.,parent_guid
110,Since my son was diagnosed I’ve felt overwhelmed and I can’t even bring myself to read anything about autism,Being an advocate for your child with autism will most likely be a lifelong activity. Early on when faced with the diagnosis parents are easily overwhelmed by the news. They feel confused fearful and angry. Many tire easily as they try to cope. It is helpful to remember that you are not alone that others are going through this so there is support available for you. Keep a folder of articles and other information material so that when you are able to read it you will have it available. Pace yourself and in time you will do what needs to be done and your efforts over time will make a difference,parent_guid
111,My family’s involvement in church is important to us. How do I get my church to be more accepting of my son,For many people including those members of your church autism is not something they may have experience with or adequate information about so you must help educate them. A good place to start is with your pastor or minister. See what he or she knows and offer information as needed. Sometimes a leader will incorporate the related issues into a sermon or lesson. He or she can also suggest folks who can be approached as more open to learning about autism. Then suggest the church invite a professional to do a workshop on special needs children with emphasis on the challenges associated with autism. Suggest the church develop a plan to accommodate special needs children in their various activities such as the Sunday school classes the worship service the choir etc. At some point it may be helpful to bring in a behavioral specialist to work with and train the staff. It may mean asking teachers parents and other trained professionals in the church to volunteer time helping out in Sunday school modifying the lessons etc. Get your community involved and they will thank you later!Once members of your congregation are given accurate information they will become more open and supportive. You may have to suggest ways they can become involved with your child and with advocacy organizations. There are so many opportunities for the religious community to get involved and to partner with parents. As advocates parents have a unique opportunity to lead the charge.,parent_guid
112,How do I know everything possible is being done for my child? Sometimes it seems like not enough progress is being made,Almost daily every parent with a child with autism asks this question: is there more that can be done to help my child? We work as hard as we can yet very often we feel as though we aren’t doing enough. It is also easy for us to project this on to others involved in our child’s life. In fact historically not enough has been done and in many ways more should be done in today’s world. This is what advocacy is all about. We must continue to push for the best treatments and services available,parent_guid
113,Is there any financial assistance available to assist in the care and education for our child with autism,Financial difficulty is one of the biggest stressors that families with special needs children face. There seems to never be enough funding or financial help available and each family often finds that their own resources are stretched by providing for their child with little hope of reimbursement for all that gets spent.The primary funding source for your child’s services is mandated through a United States federal law the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention special education and related services to children with disabilities. In addition your family’s medical insurance may reimburse you for autism services such as speech therapy or behavioral health treatment such as Applied Behavior Analysis. Start by speaking with the human resources department where you or your spouse work and inquire about insurance reimbursement for autism services. Many states now have government agencies monitoring the health insurance industry so this can be a back-up resource to explore benefits as needed. Continuing to advocate for increased funding by the government and by the insurance industry is important. For more information about autism insurance reform in your state visit the Autism Speaks website.,parent_guid
114,My wife and I worry that over time our other children will develop deep resentments for all the attention and “special treatment” their brother gets and this could negatively impact their lives. Do you have any suggestions for raising our other children so they don’t feel resentment,Sibling rivalry occurs in all families with more than one child and it can be especially complex when it involves a child with special needs. There is no way to avoid giving some extra attention and treatment to a child with autism. For siblings of children with autism these feelings may develop early because the children may be together all the time. Constantly checking in with your other children about how they are doing what they need etc. is a good start. Finding time to be with each child individually also helps immensely when possible. Involving grandparents aunts uncles trusted neighbors etc. may help as well. Children at various ages have the capacity to understand the special needs of someone else if you take the time to explain in terms they will understand. Explain behaviors they see in their brother or sister and why you respond differently to deal with these situations. While you don’t want them to become surrogate parents they do need to know some basic explanations. Also creating a safe space for them to talk about their feelings with you or with others can prevent later development of toxic resentments. Helping your other children find successful ways to play or interact with their brother or sister is powerful. Siblings may sometimes feel guilty because they do feel resentment and anger or even just because they are “normal” while their brother or sister is not. Guilt and resentment are normal growing up issues made more complex often because of a special needs sibling. But like any feeling they can be talked about and processed so that your other children move forward in their own emotional development and life journeys.,parent_guid
