https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912781-print 30/43Citalopram (Celexa)
Citalopram enhances serotonin activity by selective reuptake inhibition of serotonin at the neuronal membrane. Dose-
"dependent QT prolongation has been reported with citalopram.[149, 150] . This agent is contraindicated in patients with"
congenital long QT syndrome.
Escitalopram (Lexapro)
Escitalopram is an S-enantiomer of citalopram. The mechanism of action is thought to be potentiation of serotonergic activity
"in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting from the inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin."
Stimulants
Class Summary
"Stimulants may be effective for treating hyperactivity associated with ASD. The magnitude of response, however, is less"
than that seen in developmentally normal children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
"Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Quillivant XR, Ritalin LA, Concerta)"
Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase
the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture composed of the d-
and l-enantiomers. The d-enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-enantiomer.
Alpha-2-adrenergic agonists
Class Summary
"Alpha-2-adrenergic agonists may facilitate the management of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children with"
ASD.
"Clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Kapvay)"
"Clonidine stimulates alpha-2-adrenoreceptors in the brain stem, activating an inhibitory neuron, which in turn results in"
reduced sympathetic outflow. These effects result in a decrease in vasomotor tone and heart rate. May aid in the treatment
of agression in children and adolescents.
Guanfacine (Intuniv)
"Guanfacine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, may preferentially bind postsynaptic alpha-2A adrenoreceptors in the prefrontal"
"cortex, and this preferential binding may improve delay-related firing of prefrontal cortex neurons. As a result, guanfacine"
may affect behavioral inhibition. It has been used off label to reduce hyperactivity in children.
